# CS-584
My work in CS 584 (Theory and Applications of Data Mining) at Mason, fall 2016

Homework 1 - See src. Assignment is to classify Amazon reviews' sentiment with our own implementation of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm.

Homework 2 - See src. Assignment is to classify whether a compound binds to a receptor based on known compounds' features and activity. The domain is drug discovery, where drugs are typically small organic molecules that achieve their desired activity by binding to a target site on a receptor. It is the Dorothea data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dorothea. This was a group project where I had one partner, Robert Truong.

Homework 3 - See src. Assignment is to implement my own kMeans Classifier to cluster text documents, particularly news.
